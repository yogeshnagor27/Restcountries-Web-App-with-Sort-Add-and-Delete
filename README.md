# Restcountries-Web-App-with-Sort-Add-and-Delete

## Restcountries Web App
This web application uses the Restcountries API to obtain country information for Austria, Hungary, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovia. The countries are displayed in a table with the following information:

* Flag
* Title
* Population
* Link to Google Maps
The table also includes a filter bar that allows the user to sort the table by population or name in ascending order.

# Features
* Displays country information from the Restcountries API for four countries
* Sorts table by population or name
* Saves the list of countries so that it is not rebuilt from scratch when the page is refreshed
* Allows the user to add a new country to the list using the CCA country code (2 digits)
* Allows the user to delete entries from the table

# How to Use
To use this web application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The table with the country information will be displayed. To sort the table by population or name, use the filter bar at the top of the table. To add a new country to the list, enter the country's CCA country code (2 digits) in the input field and click the "Add country" button. If the code is not valid, an error message will be displayed. To delete an entry from the table, click the "Delete" button in the corresponding row.

# Technologies Used
This web application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Restcountries API was used to obtain the country information.

# Future Improvements
Possible improvements for this web application include:
* Adding more countries to the list
* Allowing the user to filter the table by other criteria, such as region or language
* Implementing a more user-friendly way to add countries, such as a dropdown menu with country names instead of requiring the user to enter the CCA code
* Adding error handling for other types of errors that may occur when using the Restcountries API, such as network errors or rate limiting errors

# Credits
This web application was created by me and The country information was obtained from the Restcountries API.
